# RTS_Simulation

Test Map doesnt work properly. But still spawns NPC and Tilemap. But cant run the AI.

On the other hand I tested NPC AI on FormationMap and AITesterMap. Works fine.

I didn't have time to spawn pointers to groups based on distance.

I would like to add widget but NPC AI took all my time. I tried to move them in formation since the pointer will appear for group.

Both have C++, mixed and Blueprints in project. I tried to implement my blueprint algorithms in C++. That is how I work basically.


Achieved:
-Camera
-AI spawning, Tile spawning, AI's Behaviour Tree, Particle.

Unachieved:
-Group Pointer, widget for spawn decider.

Delivered.
