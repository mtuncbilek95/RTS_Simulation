# RTS_Simulation

Test Map doesnt work properly. But still spawns NPC and Tilemap. But cant run the AI.

On the other hand I tested NPC AI on FormationMap and AITesterMap. Works fine.

I didn't have time to spawn pointers to groups based on distance.

I would like to add widget but NPC AI took all my time. I tried to move them in formation since the pointer will appear for group. 

Delivered.
